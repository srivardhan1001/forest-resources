        <h2>Sapling</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\asus\Downloads\download (2).jpg" alt="sapling">
        <p>Tree planting is recognised as one of the most engaging, environmentally-friendly activities that people can participate in to help the planet when done properly. Trees provide numerous long-term and short-term benefits. They not only look nice, but they also remove and store carbon from the atmosphere, slow heavy rain and thus reduce the risk of flooding, improve air quality, and reduce the urban heat island effect by reflecting sunlight and providing shade. Let us take a look at the long and short essay on tree plantation.</p>
<h2>Lumber</h2>
<div class="pt">
<img src="C:\Users\asus\Downloads\Timber Logging in Austrian Alps Stock Photo - Image of wildlife, logging_ 25352238.jpg" alt="timber"></div>
<p>Lumber refers to processed wood that has been cut, sawn, and shaped for use in construction and other applications.
  <br>
  Trees, typically softwood or hardwood species, are harvested and transported to sawmills.
  <br>
  At sawmills, logs are processed through various machines to produce different types of lumber, such as boards, planks, and beams.
  <br>
  The lumber may undergo additional treatments like drying and preservation to enhance its durability.
  <br>
  Construction: Lumber is a primary material for building structures, framing houses, and constructing various wooden components in buildings.
Furniture: Many types of furniture are made from lumber, including tables, chairs, and cabinets.
Flooring: Wooden flooring is often made from processed lumber.
Crafting: Lumber is used in a variety of DIY projects and crafting activities.

<h2>Biodiversity</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\asus\Downloads\Tempo do clima.jpg" height="500" alt="Biodiversity">
<p>Biodiversity, short for biological diversity, refers to the variety of life on Earth at all levels of biological organization, including the diversity of species, ecosystems, and genetic diversity within species. It encompasses the totality of genes, species, and ecosystems in a given area. Biodiversity is crucial for the health of the planet and plays a significant role in sustaining life and supporting human well-being. </p>
<br>
<p>More than 99.9% of all species that ever lived on Earth, amounting to over five billion species, are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86% have not yet been described. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as four trillion tons of carbon. In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth.</p>
<h2>Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs):</h2>
<h3>Fruits and Nuts:</h3>
<div class="nuts">
<img src="C:\Users\asus\Downloads\Raw nuts & Dried Fruit Product Photography.jpg" height="375" alt="fruits and nuts">
<div class="text">
<p>Fruits and nuts derived from forest ecosystems are important components of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance. These forest resources have both ecological and economic significance, providing sustenance for wildlife and serving as a source of nutrition and income for human populations.</p>

<h3>Medicinal Plants:</h3>
<div class="nuts">
  <img src="C:\Users\asus\Downloads\DIY Inspo_ How To Stock Your Own Herbal Medicine Cabinet.jpg" height="375" alt="medicinal plants">
  <div class="text">
    <p>Medicinal plants are a valuable subset of forest resources, offering a diverse range of plants with properties that have been traditionally and scientifically recognized for their medicinal and healing properties. These plants have been used for centuries by various cultures and communities around the world for treating illnesses, maintaining health, and supporting overall well-being</p>

<h3>Resins and Gums:</h3>
<div class="nuts">
  <img src="C:\Users\asus\Downloads\What are Resins and Gums in Plants_.jpg" height="375" width="375 alt="Resins">
  <div class="text">
    <p>In polymer chemistry and materials science, a resin is a solid or highly viscous substance of plant or synthetic origin that is typically convertible into polymers.[1] Resins are usually mixtures of organic compounds. This article focuses mainly on naturally occurring resins.Plants secrete resins for their protective benefits in response to injury.</p>

<h3>Water Resources:</h3>
<div class="nuts">
  <img src="C:\Users\asus\Downloads\CONSERVATION _ Cariboo-Chilcotin Conservation Society _ Water Footprints.jpg" height="375" alt="water">
  <div class="text">
    <p>Water resources are natural resources of water that are potentially useful for humans, for example as a source of drinking water supply or irrigation water. 97% of the water on Earth is salt water and only three percent is fresh water; slightly over two-thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction present above ground or in the air. Natural sources of fresh water include surface water, under river flow, groundwater and frozen water. Artificial sources of fresh water can include treated wastewater (wastewater reuse) and desalinated seawater. Human uses of water resources include agricultural, industrial, household, recreational and environmental activities.</p>

<h3>Cimate Regulations:</h3>

  <div class="text">
    <p>Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) is the use of various technologies to control the temperature, humidity, and purity of the air in an enclosed space. Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality. HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, based on the principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. "Refrigeration" is sometimes added to the field's abbreviation as HVAC&R or HVACR, or "ventilation" is dropped, as in HACR (as in the designation of HACR-rated circuit breakers).</p>

<h3>Renewable energy:</h3>
<div class="nuts">
  <img src="C:\Users\asus\Downloads\Premium Photo _ Green energy for a sustainable future the esg concept of environmental generative ai.jpg" height="375" alt="re">
  <div class="text">
<p>Renewable energy is energy from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. Renewable resources include sunlight, wind, the movement of water, and geothermal heat. Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not. For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation. Renewable energy is often used for electricity generation, heating and cooling. Renewable energy projects are typically large-scale, but they are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development.</p>
